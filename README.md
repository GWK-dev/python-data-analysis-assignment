✅ Professional styling with seaborn

🔍 Key Findings
Dataset Information
Dataset: Iris (150 samples, 5 features)

Features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width, species

Species: setosa, versicolor, virginica

No missing values: Dataset is complete and clean

Statistical Insights
Setosa species have significantly smaller petal dimensions

Virginica species show the largest petal measurements

Strong correlation between petal length and petal width

Clear separation between species in scatter plots

Standard deviation varies significantly across species groups

📈 Visualizations Generated
Line Chart: Shows trends in sepal length across sample indices

Bar Chart: Compares average sepal length by species with value labels

Histogram: Displays distribution of sepal length measurements

Scatter Plot: Reveals relationship between sepal length and width, colored by species
